title: Quantum vs Thermodynamics?

Had a nice chat emerge out of all this [Time Crystal][time crystal nature] stuff, which reinvigorated a few head scratchers for me around quantum and thermodynamics.

Main query:

>>>whether the oddly perpetual motion of time crystals, oscillation of superstrings, or vanilla particle spin; there seem to be naughty motions going on which are using non-universe energy without introducing new energy to our universe - is this an edge case, a misunderstanding on my part, or something more interesting?)

Stumbled across this in the process: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1016/261016-quantum-thermodynamics-law
