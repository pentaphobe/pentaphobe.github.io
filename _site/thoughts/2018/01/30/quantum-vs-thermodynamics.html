<p>Had a nice chat emerge out of all this <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-quest-to-crystallize-time-1.21595?href">Time Crystal</a> stuff, which reinvigorated a few head scratchers for me around quantum and thermodynamics.</p>

<p>Main query:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>whether the oddly perpetual motion of time crystals, oscillation of superstrings, or vanilla particle spin; there seem to be naughty motions going on which are using non-universe energy without introducing new energy to our universe - is this an edge case, a misunderstanding on my part, or something more interesting?)</p>
    </blockquote>

<p>Stumbled across this in the process: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1016/261016-quantum-thermodynamics-law</p>
